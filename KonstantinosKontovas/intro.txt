It is obvious that data tells us much more than just plain random numbers. Data are like a puzzle or a riddle waitting for us to solve it and extract valuable information. My mission is to explore deeper the world of data because it has already a huge impact in our world. I have less than 1 year of experience in the data world but there is a lot more to explore. The data science course from WBS Coding School gave me the tools to start my path into the data world. I am skilled in SQL and python but there is always a lot more to explore.
